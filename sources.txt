Documentation
Data on the labor force in the “Employment” section are compiled from EPI analysis of basic monthly Current Population Survey microdata. Data reflect 12-month moving averages as of the latest month of data.

For detailed documentation of our wages and benefit calculations, see methodology.

Data by Wage Percentile
NA: Data for these 95th percentile values are currently not available because of issues with significant shares of the population facing BLS’ top-code value for weekly wages. EPI is exploring methodological changes to overcome this hurdle and obtain reliable estimates for the 95th percentile.

Wages are adjusted into 2023 dollars by the CPI-U-RS.

Population sample: Wage and salary workers ages 16 and older
